# Weighted Graph Class

A C++ implementation of a weighted graph class using an adjacency matrix representation.

## Overview

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a weighted graph class. Weighted graphs are graphs in which each edge has an associated numerical value called weight. The class provides functionality for managing vertices and edges, calculating distances between vertices, and printing the graph's adjacency matrix.

## Features

- **Vertex and Edge Management**: Insert and manage vertices and edges.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the shortest distance between two vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Graph Representation**: Visualize the graph's adjacency matrix.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Throw exceptions for invalid operations or out-of-bounds vertex indices.

## Installation

1. Include the `weighted_graph.h` header file in your C++ project
2. Use skeleton files to test.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Create a `Weighted_graph` object.
2. **Vertex and Edge Operations**: Insert vertices and edges using the `insert` method.
3. **Graph Queries**: Retrieve information about vertices, edges, and distances using appropriate methods.
4. **Printing**: Print the adjacency matrix of the graph using the `operator<<` overload.

## Files Included

- **Weighted_graph.h**: Header file for the weighted graph class implementation.
